# Quest-of-Con

It's a science fiction turn-based strategy game that I made. You build a HQ and various other buildings to help you destroy everyone else's HQ's. It has lots of cool features, like:

- Randomly generated terrain
- Elevation levels in that terrain
- Biomes
- Defensive buffs based on elevation change
- Online multiplayer
- Deadly robots

It's guaranteed to be _not_ bug free! Try it now!
